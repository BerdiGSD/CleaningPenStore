    <h3>Return Policy</h3>
    <p>We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after
    receiving your item to request a return.</p>
    
    <h3>Eligibility</h3>
    <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that
    you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging.
    You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.</p>
    
    <h3>How to Return</h3>
    <p>To start a return, you can contact us at <a
    href="mailto:info@ticatide.com">info@ticatide.com</a>. If your return is
    accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as well as instructions on
    how and where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first
    requesting a return will not be accepted.</p>
    
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>You can always contact us for any return question at <a
    href="mailto:info@ticatide.com">info@ticatide.com</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Damages and Issues</h3>
    <p>Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if
    the item is defective, damaged, or if you receive the wrong item, so that we
    can evaluate the issue and make it right.</p>
    
    <h3>Exceptions</h3>
    <p>Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods, custom
    products, personal care goods, hazardous materials, flammable liquids, or
    gases. Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about your
    specific item. Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift
    cards.</p>
    
    <h3>Exchanges</h3>
    <p>The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you
    have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new
    item.</p>
    
    <h3>European Union 14 Day Cooling Off Period</h3>
    <p>If the merchandise is being shipped into the European Union, you have the
    right to cancel or return your order within 14 days, for any reason and
    without justification. Your item must be in the same condition that you
    received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging.
    You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.</p>
    
    <h3>Refunds</h3>
    <p>We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let
    you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be
    automatically refunded on your original payment method within 10 business
    days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card
    company to process and post the refund too. If more than 15 business days
    have passed since we’ve approved your return, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:info@ticatide.com">info@ticatide.com</a></p>
